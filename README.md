# Car Tracking Using Cpp
This algorithm is developed in C++ and OpenCV library is used in it.

## OpenCV
I useed Opencv-4.6.0 in this project. You can download it [here](https://opencv.org/releases/).

## How to run the project?
In first you need to configure the OpenCV as a following:
1. Add <code>opencv_world460.dll</code> file located in <code>[Your drive]:\Lib\OpenCV\4.7.0\opencv\build\x64\vc16\bin</code> to the global windows environment.
2. Create console application project
3. <code>project/properties/configuration/all configuration</code>
4. in <code>vc++ directories</code> tab add this directories:
    1. include directory path: <code>[Your drive]:\Lib\OpenCV\4.7.0\opencv\build\include</code>
    2. library directory path: <code>[Your drive]:Lib\OpenCV\4.7.0\opencv\build\x64\vc16\lib</code>
5. Compile project and run it!    

## Result
